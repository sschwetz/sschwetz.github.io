#### CHAPTER 2 - DOLLY'S LOLLIES







WARNING!! THIS CHAPTER CONTAINS A SCENE THAT IS ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT. DO NOT READ THIS CHAPTER IF YOU ARE TRIGGERED BY THAT SORT OF THING!







We finally arrived at the shop. We had walked for 15 minutes to get to this shop, so we were very puffed, and Abbey and Paige had to use their puffers quickly before we went inside the store. Once they were done, we walked inside the store.
‘Hello! My name is John and welcome to Dolly’s Lollies. I’ll be over at the checkout once you find out what you want.’
This shop was super weird. The shop wasn’t really a ‘shop’, it was more of a restaurant. We looked around for the menus and ended up finding them on the table. We then proceeded to look through them, and see what we wanted. The menu was quite extensive, and consisted of many different items. There were things like Coke Bottles and Milk Bottles and Strawberries and Cream, and many other lollies. Lilian decided that once everyone had decided what they wanted, she would go and order them. She picks up Paige’s money, and walks up to the counter. John wasn’t there. She then turned around and heard movement in a storage room. Lilian walked into the storage room when all of a sudden, the door slams behind her. She turns to look straight ahead, then a light turns on. John jumps up like a tiger and pulls Lilian down to the ground. The next thing that happens is Lilian’s pants get pulled down, and John pulls his pants down as well. Then, John proceeds to sexually assault Lilian. Lilian starts to scream as loud as she can. 

Outside, the girls are sitting out at their table, when they hear the sound of the door slamming, and a big loud thump.
‘Lilian? Lilian, are you okay?’ Abbey asks.
All of a sudden, there is a loud scream. As soon as they hear the scream, they run out of the restaurant and continue to run all the way out of the shopping centre, while screaming as loud as they can. They run to the car park and call Paige’s mum. Thankfully, Paige’s mum didn’t go very far from the shopping centre, and picked them up 5 minutes later.

Suddenly, she stops feeling the feeling that she has been feeling for the past 10 minutes. I looked up at where he was laying, and he was standing up, putting his pants back on and leaving. Once he had left, I put my pants back on and tried to open the door to leave, and it was stuck. I couldn’t leave. I grabbed my phone off the floor and called Taloa.
‘Please pick up, please pick up.’ I whisper under my breath.
‘Lilian. Oh my god. Are you okay?’
‘Yeah. I think he’s done except-’
I get interrupted mid sentence by a big crashing coming from the ceiling. I look up and see Ella flying above me.
‘Grab on!’ Ella says.
I grab tightly onto one of her claws, as she quickly flies away.
‘Hey guys, don’t worry about picking me up, Ella already did!’ I say as I hung up the phone.
‘What the hell?’ Emily asks.
‘I don’t know either. Mum, let’s go!’
