### Preamble

For years I knew that I was different to the rest of my peers. I didn't know why, but lots of things just seemed different. I wasn't interested in the same things that my peers were, and many of them didn't seem to keen on myself either. 

I have been thinking about what I would like this site to offer; I am not talking about goods and services but more about what it can be used for. Do I want it just to be zany and out there, documenting whatever I feel about bitching about for that day, which is what it currently is? But I don't think that is what I want.  I want this site to have a purpose, to become a collection of articles, possibly poorly written by myself, that offer either insight or knowledge that I have gained, to allow me to feed this knowledge back and hopefully stop someone from making the same mistakes I have made.

I thought that I would start of with an overview of my life, and we can experiment from there.

### Early Life

My pre-school life was pretty simple, I did not attend a preschool as a child. My mother was a stay-at-home mum at that stage of her life and she took me to a playgroup once and for whatever reason we never went back. Looking on my later life I feel that this would have been very useful with my later diagnosis. But she was not aware of my issues and as I was the first child she had nothing to compare me to.

I enjoyed the time, I played with my sisters, I had a ripper sandbox, and did some :man_shrugging: of the things that kids did. We went to the beach, the pool and we went on holidays

### Primary School

In primary school, I never really had any friends, I floated around the playground trying to find my people, but I was in a smaller school, we were the biggest class with 30. So needless to say, my people were not at that school. During primary school, I don't remember doing anything to bad, execpt once where I was given the cane by the headmaster. As with most of my punishments, it was well deserved, and I took it without complaint, and then kept my mouth shut. If my mother had found out she would have shit kittens.

Whilst in primary school, I was not the smartest kid, nor did I try to be. I rested on my ability to learn and think quickly; there was no beating Karen, the girl in my class, as she was wicked smart. I never did homework, as I could not see the use of it. Why would I want to sit inside looking at books when I could be running around the backyard making a shit-tonne of noise and annoying the neighbours?

### High School

When it was time to go to high school, due to where I lived and the primary school I attended, I was given the choice of what high school I would like to attend. One was the one that most of my classmates would attend, and the other was not. For reasons I cannot explain, the more favourable choice to me was the school where I could start over again. Perhaps it was that I would be able to try and not be that wierd guy that had no friends.

It didn't work like that, as apparently, you cannot take the awkwardness and weirdo out of the autistic weirdo.  However, as this school had over one thousand students, it allowed me to find a group of four other awkward weirdos, and we became close friends in high school.  Once again, just like in primary school, I did the bare minimum to pass the subjects. 

I was an absolute turd of a child in high school. I was bored, and I didn't see how some of the subjects I was forced to take, so I would spend my time disrupting the learning that was going on. But I was a cunning turd. I knew how to push people's buttons, but even though they knew I had done something, I was shrewd enough not to get caught. My two all-time favourite escapades were:

1. stealing all the balls from the two computer room's mice. What made this even better was that to stop this from reoccuring, the school superglued the mice closed, thus they could  no longer be cleaned
2. finding a master key to left in a teacher's desk and then spending the entire lunch break finding all the unlocked classrooms and locking their desks. I got caught having locked one of them, and when I was questioned by the gestapo (I mean Duputy Principal) I would not admit to locking any other desks. I even told him that whoever did it was doing the school a favour as all the classrooms should be locked when unattended. When the referal arrived home from the school, it has ""locking the teacher~~s~~ desk.

I loved having student teachers and casuals, this was the time for massive tomfoolery. We had one student teacher who came to the school every year and was doing her pracs. Me and my friends would take great delight in when she had her back turned we would flip the transparency upside down and back to front to image the mirror, and thus no one would be able to write down the work. 

When the same student-teacher became a casual at the school, it was time to step up our game. On the bottom lens of the prism, we would put doughnuts made out of paper onto the projector so that all you could see was the small spot that came from the portion that was not covered by the paper. However, there was also some of the absolutely bad shit that we never should have done. 

In year nine maths for two terms we had a casual teacher, as our teacher had taken some of her long service leave. The new teacher was an absolute bitch. and there were five of us that were pains in the arse, and as soon as we walked in she would send four of us to face into the corners and the fifth would bee sent outside. Apart from myself there was another student that she didn't like and he held no love for her.  Come the end of the year she thought that she had the last laugh with Dennis when the teacher handed out all the results, to everyone in the class, except Dennis. 

Well Dennis was arguing his point, but she did not have any interest in giving dennis his mark. He would have to wait until his school report was handed out. However, Dennis' parents were migrants, and Dennis played his trump card. 

> "You're just not giving me my mark as you are a racist."

Now this was the mid nineteen nighties, and as a teacher to be proclaimed a racist by a student was the biggest slap in the face that can been handed out. So Dennis started,  and the other four of us took his lead chanting "racist!! racist!!". To this day I am not sure how it happened, and whether more of the class didn't like her or it was just good ol' mob mentality, the entire class was chanting it.

Eventually, she left the room in tears and would never teach again. I wish I could say that I felt some guilt over it, but I don't; as far as I am concerned, she never had the qualities of someone working in education.

From year 9 onwards, I had decided that I was going to go to school and have fun, I only had one tilt at school, and I could either work my arse off and not have any fun, but I much prefer to have the fun and leave the unnecessary subject with just a pass. Around this time, I also found my love for anything technology I loved industrial drawing (no CAD, t--square and set-squares for me), as mentioned earlier, Electronics and I found Computers.

Looking back on my resume after leaving school, I included the last three years of school reports. Most of the comments were the same.

> "Stephen could excel if he applied himself"

By the time I reached the end of year ten, I wanted out of school, I had enough and wasn't enjoying it, except for electronics. I lived and breathed for that subject; it was logical and spoke to me the subject had before in a way that nothing had ever before. However, my mother put her foot down and insisted that I complete my Higher School Certificate, which was just another piece of paper I did not need to have. I wanted to join the Air Force as a radar technician. So I continued with my education, however, continuing with my I am only going to do the fun stuff I did not study. As they always said the Higher School Certificate is just a test, and so I treated it just the same.

### University

Once I finished high school, I enrolled in university. This was honestly the first time that I felt down by my mother. She thought that I should not go to university, and she told me that to my face. But being the stubborn individual that I was, I ignored her. She refused to have anything to do with assisting me. When I started late, I asked if she could drive me to Uni on her way to work, and I was told flat-out no. 

I got a job delivering pamphlets that paid about $20 per week, and I talked to my uncle and borrowed his push bike. This allowed me to ride to university for most days, and on the days that I started late and finished late, I had the money to catch a bus to and from uni. 

### Starting In Information Technology

#### High School

![Kotara High School logo](/assets/img/2023-11-06-planning-the-future/khs_cmyk_1523318422534_m.png){: .center-image }

I had mates who did computers as a subject from year eight through to year twelve, but I never did. The school subject of computers was boring and taught by maths teachers that did a subject in uni or distance, and voila, they are now computer teachers. I looked at the course outline, and I already knew everything that they were going to teach from year eight to ten, so no fuck that, I did computers my way. I read books, I broke shit, I reinstalled MS-DOS 3.3 so many times that I had the install down to an art.

I was also good at reparing computers that I broke, I didn't ask people how to fix them, and this was before the internet. It was fixed with good old elbow grease and a hope and prayer. Learning this way, it helped my troubleshooting skill set in later life, and I could fix anything by knowing a little bit about it and brute forcing my way to a solution by finding out what didn't work.

I can also remember when the school got the internet in 1995 it was on a 14k baud modem to a single computer, and it was text based, no slip or ppp. was allowed. It was through the University of Newcastle, and being the cunning people that we were, we worked out that once you had logged into the unix shell (good old alinga) you could start up a slip daemon inside your console and then complete the connection with windows 95 and get gui based internet. Once I was onto the Internet, I was hooked, I dug into how it worked the protocols behind it with the desire to work as part of it.

#### First Job - High School

My old high school came to me in the second semester of university. It offered me two half days per week supporting their two computer rooms, library computers, and a couple of Novell Netware servers. I wasn't an employee, but a contractor and I was being paid about $20 per hour which at the time was not to be sneezed at. 

Whilst this was not a network engineering role, at the time I was happy to be what was termed a network administrator. During this time, I increased my knowledge of Redhat Linux, squid, apache and Novell Netware. During this time the NSW Department of Education rolled out 56k dialup permanent internet, and along with this I rolled out an squid proxy server that cascaded onto the Department's Squid Proxy. This allowed us to share the internet to all computers in the network. 

#### Internet Helpdesk

The next job that I picked up was a job at a local ISP called Aljan Internet. I was to man their ISP helpdesk on Saturday mornings and backfill any days that they had staff off for holidays. I had actually been chasing this job for a couple of years, it took a lot of emails, and I thought that it was never going to happen. As this was on the weekends, I kept my two half days at the school.

About 3 months into the job, the business owner won a lawsuit against [Telstra](https://telstra.com.au), who were selling multiple 2mbit unconstrained wholesale internet links in Newcastle which all underperformed as they were actually constrained. As part of the settlement, I understand that the owner agreed to sell the business, which he did. When I next turned up to work on the weekend, I went to put my alarm code into the panel and set the alarm off. I called my boss and told him that I had activated the alarm and it was not accepting my alarm code. After trying to put it in a couple of times he told me to wait there whilst he drove to the office.  When he arrived at the office, we used his alarm code and I went to work. 

However, my happiness was short-lived.  The next day my manager rang me up and apologised about what he was about to tell me, but as the new owner had taken over, he had decided that there would be no helpdesk on the weekends, and he refused to pay me for the shift that I had just done, as I wasn't meant to be there. I was gutted, I didn't know what I had done wrong or even if I had. 

I changed my internet to another carrier, and I was not surprised that the company bled customers and shut down within the next six to twelve months.

#### High School - Increased Hours

The next year the High School came back to me and offered me two and a half days per week, at the same payrate. I enjoyed this job for the next six years. It included setting up the schools first NT4 network with a domain controller, exchange 5 server and a ISA proxy server. We also installed our first Novell Netware 5 server. 

I rolled out a group policy that locked down students’ ability to damage the workstations, as this seems to be something still kicking around from my time. During this period, the Department of Education also massively increased its role in providing computer hardware for the schools, and there were no computers in every staff room, and the school had 4 computer rooms.  As these machines were now made of 3-4 models we were able to build up ghost images and a ghost server. This allowed staff to PXE boot a failed workstation, and it would be re-imaged, added back onto the domain, and back up and running within 60 minutes. Not bad when the edge switches were 10Mbit/s with a max backhaul of 100Mbit/s.

Over the next 6 years I worked on automation before automation was cool and DevOps didn't exist. There were websited that ran vbs scripts to reset passwords, and email passwords either to the class teacher or if it was a teacher to their supervisor. I implemented an bespoke php intranet, that was also at one stage published to the internet, until the department withdrew the option.

I had automated so much of the job that the network looked after itself, and most days, I would pull the blinds down and recover from going out on the town all night. I was bored and needed a change. At about the same time, I heard rumblings that the Department was looking at removing funding the schools were using for support and bringing that in-house, so I started hunting for other jobs.

#### Internet Helpdesk - Take two

Unfortunately, I was about 5 years too late to fall into a job in the industry as the industry in Australia had left behind the small garage-based industry and had become very corporate. I eventually got into a role with one of these corporates, but the job did not progress any further than the NOC, It was not what I wanted, and eventually, the ISP was sold to a British Superannuation Fund, and they closed down our account and technical support departments and off-shored them to Malaysia. 

However, I got to have the last laugh when they could not use Malaysia to support the top-tier customers and partners and eventually had to advertise the job roles back in Australia. This was the beginning of the end for the company, and within a couple of years, it was bought by Telstra global](https://telstra-global.com).

> “when I was diagnosed, it just gave me permission to be kinder to myself, to not always take responsibility for being a bit clumsy around other people, and allow me to start to tell people, “I’m clumsy, but I [don’t] mean to be.” And being more open about, “I need you to tell me what I did wrong, and then we can move on from there.”

Whilst working the ISP job above, starting as Hunterlink / [Pacific Internet](https://web.archive.org/web/20050701002541/http://www.pacific.net.au/) and [Pacnet,](https://web.archive.org/web/20120502032617/http://au.pacnet.com/) there were multiple times that I overstepped the mark, and there were times that I did things that, if an ordinary employee had done, would have been performance warned and looking back, at it on at least one occasion fired. But I was looked after by the management, which shows the sort of place that it was, as the people at the brunt of my antics were the management team The workplace in Newcastle was very relaxed, and I have never had a workplace that had the same camaraderie since.

The giant blow-up was when the Big Wig managers in Melbourne did their annual rate the company survey, and the staff slammed the upper management and how the company was slow to follow up with anything to do with the teams. The management team decided that they would put stuff in place to try and rectify it. I can't remember exactly what the trigger was, but I had asked HR for some pay information and then went on leave for a month. When I returned from the leave and checked my e-mail, there was still no answer from HR. So I emailed the HR Manager and gave her a piece of my mind. This did not go down well on my following performance review, and I received a 0% pay rise that year. For years on, we would all meet up on the days that we were made redundant and have beers, but since that time, our lives have pulled us apart.
