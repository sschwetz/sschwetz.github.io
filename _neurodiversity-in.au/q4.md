question: Running this must not be cheap
answer: Not a question, lol. Indeed it is not, currently the electricity bill for running this is in the range of $200 - $300 per month, but as it is hooked up to on-grid solar, this depends on the season of the year Australia is in and how much sun there is. Added to this is the cost of communications, though through thoughtful site design and CDN caching content, this is reduced.
