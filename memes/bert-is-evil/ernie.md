*The following is an interview with Ernie, best friend, roommate and confidant to Bert. Some scenes deemed explicit by the editor have been cut out, but still remains graphic. Reader's discretion is again stressed.*

<span style="color:yellow">**Interviewer:**</span> How long have you known Bert?

<span style="color:red">**Ernie:**</span> Oh, over 20 years now. 

<span style="color:yellow">**Interviewer:**</span> have you always lived together?

<span style="color:red">**Ernie:**</span> Yes, for as long as I remember. 

<span style="color:yellow">**Interviewer:**</span> How has it been living with him?

<span style="color:red">**Ernie:</span>** It has been really difficult.

<span style="color:yellow">**Interviewer:**</span> Difficult? Can you elaborate.

<span style="color:red">**Ernie:**</span> Well you see... um.. Bert is kinda has a dual personality... during the show, he's a pushover and very geeky. But when the camera stops rolling he becomes a raging maniac.

<span style="color:yellow">**Interviewer:</span> **Maniac.. how do you mean?

<span style="color:red">**Ernie:**</span> Well he hurts me and stuff.

<span style="color:yellow">**Interviewer:**</span> Why do you still live with him then?

<span style="color:red">**Ernie:**</span> He says if I leave the apartment he'll kill me and Rubber Duckie.

<span style="color:yellow">**Interviewer:</span>** He can't possibly be serious.

<span style="color:red">**Ernie:**</span> He is, he is very capable of this. Once, me and Duckie tried to escape... He almost strangled me to death.

<span style="color:yellow">**Interviewer:**</span> Why does he force you to stay?

<span style="color:red">**Ernie:**</span> I think he needs company, you know when he overdoses and stuff, also he likes to touch me. He ------CUT------

<span style="color:yellow">**Interviewer:**</span> Here, here, please stop crying. (pause) Are you okay now? 

<span style="color:red">**Ernie:**</span> (sniff) Yes, please continue.

<span style="color:yellow">**Interviewer:**</span> You mentioned overdosing... overdosing on what?

<span style="color:red">**Ernie:**</span> Bert experiments with all kinds of stuff, L.S.D., Speed, Ecstasy, Heroin, Cocaine, Cannabis... he taught me all the names... I hate him most when he is high.

<span style="color:yellow">**Interviewer:**</span> Why?

<span style="color:red">**Ernie:**</span> It's when he's high when he makes me do stuff.

<span style="color:yellow">**Interviewer:**</span> What kind of stuff? 

<span style="color:red">**Ernie:**</span> He makes me go to the Pigeon shed and ------CUT------ 

<span style="color:yellow">**Interviewer:**</span> What??!!

<span style="color:red">**Ernie:**</span> Please I cannot talk anymore... I gotto go.

**The Interview ended abruptly with Ernie hysterically shaking and in tears.... We persued no longer, this soul was already in too much pain.**
