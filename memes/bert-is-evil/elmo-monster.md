**he following is an interview with Elmo, the cutest alleged heroin and cocaine addict. Some scenes deemed explicit by the editor have been cut out, but still remains graphic. Reader's discretion is again stressed.
This interview was sent in by some guy named <span style="color:red">[Azazael]</span>(mailto:madcap@webtv.net). 
**

<span style="color:yellow">Interviewer:</span> So Elmo, how long have you lived on Sesame Street?
<span style="color:red">**Elmo:**Â </span>I guess  it been about 8 years now. Im the newest one here.
<span style="color:yellow">Interviewer:</span> What was it like when you first moved here?
<span style="color:red">**Elmo:** </span>Oh, it was really nice! Everyone was so nice to me! It was like a dream! Then I met Bert...
<span style="color:yellow">Interviewer:</span> Yes?
<span style="color:red">**Elmo:** </span>yes.
<span style="color:yellow">Interviewer:</span> Um, yeah?
<span style="color:red">**Elmo:** </span>Uh, huh.
<span style="color:yellow">Interviewer:</span> What happened when you met Bert?
<span style="color:red">**Elmo:** </span>Oh, sorry. Ive been having trouble staying focused lately (this was later attributed to Elmos drug abuse) Well, everyone has been telling meto stay away from him. I thought they were kidding. But--
<span style="color:yellow">Interviewer:</span> They werent.
<span style="color:red">**Elmo:** </span>Not at all! When we first met, he pretended to be my friend. He showed me around. Then he started to do mean things.
<span style="color:yellow">Interviewer:</span> Like what?
<span style="color:red">**Elmo:** </span>One thing he liked to do was make "special cookies" for Cookie Monster. Cookie ate one during a taping, his eyes got all googly and he went berserk, shoving cookies into his mouth. Bert laughed the whole time. Said he did it alot.
<span style="color:yellow">Interviewer:</span> Thats horrible! What did you do?
<span style="color:red">**Elmo:** </span>Nothing really. I just thought it was a dumb joke. Then came the
party.
<span style="color:yellow">Interviewer:</span>Party?
<span style="color:red">**Elmo:** </span>Yeah, my welcoming party. Bert started drinking and he ----cut----
<span style="color:yellow">Interviewer:</span> Dear God!!
<span style="color:red">**Elmo:** </span>Yeah. Right there in front of everybody. After that, I tried to keep my distance from him.
<span style="color:yellow">Interviewer:</span> Did it work?
<span style="color:red">**Elmo:** </span>Not really. For a month or so he still pestered me help him in his pranks. One time he dragged me along and told Forgetful Jones that Clamentine [his wife] had died. It was awful. Poor Mr. Jones was in tears. After about five minutes, he'd forget and Bert would do it again. This went on for hours.
<span style="color:yellow">Interviewer:</span> So what finally happened?
<span style="color:red">**Elmo:** </span>I told Bert I didnt want to be his friend anymore. He stayed pretty calm, looked my right in the eye and said "----cut----" I just wanted to throw up.
<span style="color:yellow">Interviewer:</span> Elmo, youre a very brave little puppet for doing this interview. I wish you luck.

For some reason, this interview never made it to the papers. I attempted to track down the interviewer to ask him why, only to discover that he'd vanished a mere three days after the interview took place. Coincidence?

Maybe.
