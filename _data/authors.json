On this site, you will find everything from the braindumps of technical data to braindumps of things that I need to take off my head to keep sane.\nI enjoy technology, IoT and photography. I have shared care arrangements for my two girls with my ex-partner, with the eldest being with me 50% of the time. The younger wants to spend more time with her mum, so I have her three days per fortnight.\n\nAll photographs shown on this siteâ€™s home screen have been taken by myself./n"
