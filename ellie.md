Hi! I’m Ellie, and this is my blog page. Here, you can follow the comings and goings of Myself, Ellie the Stupid. I am Emma’s pride, joy, and the bane of everyone else’s existence. To Emma, I am a sweet angel full of love, and to everyone else, I am just a Rat-Dog who is never afforded the respect I deserve.

Come back occasionally and stay updated on how annoying I can be.
