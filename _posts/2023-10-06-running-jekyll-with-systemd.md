I have been moving my blog over from writefreely to jekyll the last couple of days and that is why it has been a bit quiet on the posting side. 

The move was not a well thought out excercise and could have been made a whole lot easier, but I accidently deleted the VM that that had the mysql database from write freely, so it ended up being a recover what I could from archive.orgs wayback machine.
