If you have stumbled into this little area of the internet, you probably wonder what you have gotten into. This is where I try to note the mundane and sometimes very interesting things that happen in my daily life.

I used to do this a while ago, but due to work pressures, I had to give it up as I didn't have time to do it, and I have noticed that without getting this shit out of my system that my mental health has been taking a downhill run.

I have set out the following rules:

* No going back and changing content - this means that there will be spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, but that is part and parcel of what I am doing

* These posts will be, in part, just rambling, as I am just writing down whatever comes into my head.
* No real topic is required to post, but the odd post may be worth reading.
* No matter how shitty the day has been, I must find something to fill in as today's fun bit

Today was a slower day at work, but it was still chock-a-block full of meetings

Emma has been more awake today; we had dinner together for the first time in ages. It was enjoyable.

###### Today's Fun Bit:

Today is massage day; for the first time in a long time, I managed to stay awake nearly the whole time.
