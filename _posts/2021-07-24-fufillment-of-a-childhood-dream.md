## The Issues.

As you may recall, I am a [type 1 diabetic](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025115019/https://wordpress.schwetz.com.au/2021/07/24/my-journey-begins/), and due to my health insurance covering an insulin pump, I thought I would look at how these work out for my life.

I have spent the last 7 months struggling with managing my diabetes, I was finding that my ADHD was interfering with all the moving parts in proper management. I would take BGLs, eat and then forget the insulin. I would take the BGLs and insulin and then forget to eat.)

About a month ago, I had the pre-pump class, where you are taught the basics about how a pump works. Once you understand how to work out how many carbohydrates you will eat, do a food diary showing how these will all fit together. If you were found to be suitable for a pump, then the process starts to get one.

Later that week, I got the call that I was hoping for; not only had I been successful, but I was the only person who could recall all the food types that had carbohydrates, and this class had people in it who were in their 60s diagnosed as children.

## The Solution.

I decided on a [Tandem T-Slim X2](https://amsldiabetes.com.au/products/tslim-x2-insulin-pump/), and luckily, the month before, they had been permitted to be re-released for sale by the TGA. This unit can be paired with [Dexcom G6 Constant Glucose Monitoring](https://amsldiabetes.com.au/products/dexcom-g6/), helping give me coverage from any hypos by switching insulin delivery off for up to 2 hours. The other benefit is that I will not have to prick my fingers as often, which is good as they now look like Swiss cheese.

> Add all this together, and I have an all-in-one solution to manage my diabetes with fewer moving parts.

## The Price.

There is a downside to this. Cost. Whilst the pump itself was ‚Äúfree‚Äù, its consumables were not. The CGM is $330 per month [on a subscription](https://amsldiabetes.com.au/dexcom-330-all-rounder-subscription-program/) for 12 months, a 36 per cent saving on purchasing the items monthly. The consumables for the pump will work out to be about $50 per month.

It has been just shy of a week, and only time will tell if I can manage to sustain the cost of the CGM component, but currently, the reduction in alarms on my phone to remind me to do things around managing my Diabetes is a relief. Now I have the alarms during the day to remind me to eat ü•¥

I will allow this some time to bed in and will come and provide an updated post about how I am travelling in about a month.
