Today wasn't the most productive day, as my brain decided that it needed to be broken and I was not functioning so I called in sick and then back to bed until 1:30. The only thing that made this worse was that I was supposed to have a Drs appointment at 12:45, the fact that I forgot about it means that they will charge me a sixty-five dollar non-attendance fee. But shit will happen...

I spent some time instead of just chilling. 

I spent an hour or so this afternoon getting the third access point into the kid's hallway near Isabelle's room, she had mentioned that there were periods that she would be disconnected from the internet, and she would then have to reconnect.

I am going to try and get some more work done on the front and side of the house, but first I need to see if I can borrow the stincoln's wheelbarrow.

###### Fun Fact:

Today after Emma had a nap we sat outside on the alfresco and talked about her psychology session yesterday and her excitement in getting a new job.
