To avoid automatic password expiry for root, audit and admin users on both NSX manager and Edges we can set the password expiry to 9999 days. This is better than disabling password expiry altogether as some checks later might require password expiry to be enabled.

SSH to the manager using individual IP (not cluster IP) using admin credentials

Run the following commands to prevent password expiration for the three accounts:

## Increasing the Number of Days to Password Expiry

```
set user admin password-expiration 9999
set user audit password-expiration 9999
set user root password-expiration 9999
```

## Validate settings have taken effect:

```
get user admin password-expiration
get user audit password-expiration
get user root password-expiration
```
