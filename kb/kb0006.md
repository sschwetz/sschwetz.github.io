There will be times within the NSX lifecycle when you could be required to deploy a new edge node, including:

* The edge node has become cpu constrained;
* The NSX environment needs to have additional throughput, and you are already running large edge nodes; or
* The edge node has become corrupted and needs to be replaced to restore service.

[^fn2]: Ensure that you have selected the correct node sizing for the workload that you are expecting, as you cannot resize an edge node, you will have to deploy a new edge node of the correct size and  [replace it](KB0007 = Replacing an Edge Node.md)
