[FRRD](https://docs.frrouting.org) is the routing daemon that NSX uses as the data plane. To access this you use the cli command `vtysh`. 

*vtysh* can call an external paging program (e.g. *more* or *less*) to paginate long output from commands. This feature used to be enabled by default but is now controlled by the `VTYSH_PAGER`environment variable and the [`terminal paginate`](https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/vtysh.html#clicmd-terminal-paginate) command:

## VTYSH_PAGER

If set, the `VTYSH_PAGER` environment variable causes *vtysh* to pipe output from commands through the given command. Note that this happens regardless of the length of the output. As such, standard pager behaviour (mainly waiting at the end of output) tends to annoy the user. Using `less -EFX` is recommended for a better user experience.If this environment variable is unset, *vtysh* defaults to not using any pager. Users should set this variable according to their preferences in their `~/.profile` file.

## `terminal paginate`

Enables/disables vtysh output pagination. This command can be placed in `vtysh.conf` to set a system-wide default. If this is enabled, but `VTYSH_PAGER` is not set, the system default pager (likely `more` or `/usr/bin/pager`) will be used.
