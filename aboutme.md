Welcome to my little corner of the internet. On this site, you will find everything from the braindumps of technical data to braindumps of things that I need to take off my head to keep sane.

I enjoy technology, IoT and photography. I have shared care arrangements for my two girls with my ex-partner, with the eldest being with me 50% of the time. The younger wants to spend more time with her mum, so I have her three days per fortnight.

All photographs shown on this site's home screen have been taken by myself.
